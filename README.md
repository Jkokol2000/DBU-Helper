The Dragon Ball Universe Helper is a site designed to help new players get into the fan-made tabletop RPG, Dragon Ball Universe. As of right now, it allows a player to create a new, level 1 character, and allows game masters to create new campaigns. Players can then join those campaigns as they appear in the campaign list.
